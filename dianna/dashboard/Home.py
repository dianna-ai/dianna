    **DIANNA** (Deep Insight And Neural Network Analysis) is a Python package that brings explainable AI (XAI)
    to your research project. <br>
    It wraps _systematically_ selected XAI methods (**explainers**) in a simple, uniform interface.<br>
    It's built by, with and for academic researchers and research software engineers
    who use AI, but users not need to be XAI experts! <br>
    DIANNA supports the de-facto standard format of neural network models - [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/:).

    ### Dashboard
    The DIANNA dashboard can be used for explanation of the outcomes of several ONNX models trained for the tasks
    and datasets presented
    in the [DIANNA Tutorials](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/tree/main/tutorials#datasets-and-tasks).

    The dashboard shows the visual explanation of a models' outcome
    on a selected data _instance_ by one or more selected explainers. <br>
    It allows you to compare the results of different explainers, as well as explanations
    of the top ranked predicted model outcomes.

    There are separate sections for each of the different _data modalities_ supported by DIANNA:
    :gray-background[**Image**], :gray-background[**Text**],
    :gray-background[**Tabular**], and :gray-background[**Time series**] data. <br>
    The visual explanation is an overlaid on the data instance :rainbow-background[**heatmap**]
    highlighting the relevance (attribution) of each data instance _element_ to a selected model's outcome.<br>
    The data element for images is a (super)pixel, for text - a word, for tabular data - an attribute,
    and for time-series -  a time interval. Attributions can be positive, negative or irrelevant.<br>
    To interpret heatmaps, note that attributions are bound between -1 and 1.
    The maximum (positive) value is set to 1 and the minimum (negative)  value to -1.<br>
    The dashboard uses the _bwr  (blue white red)_ colormap assigning :blue[**blue**] color to negative
    relevances, **white** color to near-zero values, and :red[**red**] color to positive values.

    The dashboard _primarily_ illustrates the examples from the DIANNA tutorials.

    It is also possible to upload _own_ trained (ONNX) model and data item for which you would like
    the model's decision explanation.<br>
    You can then select the explainer you want to use and set its hyperparameters.
