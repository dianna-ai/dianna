# Current and planned DIANNA developments

- Scientific use-cases: the use of XAI in scientific applicaitons: tutorials and videos

- Other data modalities: we plan support for graphs.

- Embeddings: We plan to add support for embeddings as a data modality in the near future. This will allow users to create the same or similar explanations and visualizations for their models that is projecting data towards embedded spaces.
